#A Series is a one-dimensional array containing a sequence of values of any data type (int, float, list, string, etc)

#to import pandas library:

import pandas as pd

#Creation of Series

#(A) Creation of Series from Scalar Values:
series1 = pd.Series([10,20,30])
print(series1)

#0    10
#1    20
#2    30

#(B) Creation of Series from NumPy Arrays
#We can create a series from a one-dimensional (1D) NumPy array
import numpy as np      # import NumPy with alias np
array1 = np.array([1,2,3,4])
series3 = pd.Series(array1)
print(series3)

#0     1 
#1     2 
#2     3 
#3     4 
#dtype: int32
